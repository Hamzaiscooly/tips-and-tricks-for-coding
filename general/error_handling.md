# Error Handling

- Handle errors gracefully; don’t crash the program.
- Catch specific errors, not all exceptions.
- Always log or report errors; don’t hide them.
- Validate inputs before processing.
- Use try-catch (or language equivalent) blocks where needed.
- Clean up resources (files, connections) even on errors.
