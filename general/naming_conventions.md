# Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive, meaningful names.
- Be consistent with style (camelCase, snake_case, PascalCase).
- Avoid abbreviations unless widely known.
- Use nouns for variables/classes, verbs for functions.
- Keep names concise but clear.
- Prefix boolean variables with `is` or `has` (e.g., `isValid`).
